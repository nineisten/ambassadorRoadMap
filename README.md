# Qubic USA Roadmap: Season 4 Objectives

## Overview

This unified roadmap for Qubic USA outlines a strategic plan to build a robust ambassador network, enhance both online and real-world outreach, and drive community growth. It integrates online social media efforts with real-world activities to create a cohesive All-American narrative that appeals to the US market. Progress will be tracked by epochs, aligned with Qubic's blockchain cycles, to ensure ecosystem synergy. Weekly meetings will maintain network synchronization, with participants missing more than three meetings in a month removed from the active US ambassador roster.

Key Principles:
- Prioritize high-impact onboarding and performance-based compensation.
- Secure funding and resources for sustainable growth.
- Foster collaboration with blockchain organizations, educational institutions, and sponsors.
- Track KPI performance, which will influence the amount of Qubic rewarded.
- Emphasize decentralization linked to American ideals, such as freedom and the Constitution, while highlighting Qubic's advantages (e.g., tax implications from PoS chains vs. Qubic's XMR mining rewards).
- Promote Anna to illustrate the difference between an LLM AI model and an AGI self-evolving model.

## Team Structure

### Current Team

   - Begin conversations on how Qubic enhances American life, linking decentralization with the Constitution and ideologies of freedom.
   - Main focus: Compare taxes from PoS chains' revenue to Qubic's XMR mining rewards.
   - Promote Anna to provide context on LLM vs. AGI models.
   - Create AI-generated promotional material to share among ambassadors.
